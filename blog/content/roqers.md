title: Roqers
description: |
  Roq is a powerful static site generator that combines the best features of tools like Jekyll and Hugo, but within the Java ecosystem. It offers a modern approach with Quarkus at its core, requiring zero configuration to get started â€”ideal for developers who want to jump right in, while still being flexible enough for advanced users to hook into Java for deeper customization.
